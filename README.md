I like the default profile pictures.

I **do not** support, participate in, or produce anything related to academic misconduct, however I believe students should be taught in a way that they can learn and grow rather than focusing on memorization, punishment, and being treated like a factory worker.

I **do** support the archival and documentation of media and history.

I **do not** support stealing from small studios, individuals, or indepentant creators, but I'll look in the other direction if it's from greedy corporations, massive game studios, or exploitive individuals.
